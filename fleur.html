                            mission is to foster positive transformation in women via physical and interpersonal strength through body awareness, self-expression
                            and feminine empowerment. Our vision is for women to feel comfortable and confident in their
                            expression; physically own what they say; be unapologetic about who they are; and free themselves
                            to self-actualize.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>“When I dance, I dance also in my mind, I let the flow lead me. This improvisation is the ultimate freedom
                        in self expression. Embracing how your body moves and how it responds to different textures, temperatures,
                        thoughts enhances self-awareness. By allowing yourself to be vulnerable within the sequences and
                        letting them become part of your soul -as your natural rhythm -will promote clarity and self-love”.

                            workshops over the course of 8 weeks. The first week is Body, Breathe, & Soul where we will get
                            to know each other while we begin our journey of self discovery. The following weeks is focused
                            on sensual movement and dance. We will then do an intimate photography session in week 6 and
                            reflect back on it through movement in week 7. The final week is our performance week where we
                            will share our movement in a safe space together.</p>

                        <h4>Body, Breath & Soul Level 1 </h4>
                        <p>
                            Body, Breath and Soul is about creating a sacred space to express yourself through journaling, breath & movement, meditation,
                            and spiritual connection. It’s about finding your truth by looking inward, peeling away the layers,
                            and finding your true essence. This will include creating sacred space with personal items which
                            are meaningful to you. Fill your space with a meaningful quote or a poem, and any other items
                            that uplift your spirit, such as a rock, crystal or a feather. When we sit with ourself and create
                            space either with morning rituals of prayer, meditation or dance, we allow ourself to be free
                            from the ego. When we connect the heart and mind with our true essence, a deep union of spirit
                            can blossom.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Sacred, Sensual Self Level 1</h4>
                        <p>Sacred Sensual Self is about re-claiming your sensual self by integrating and healing your sensuality
                            as part of your soul, choreographing your loving being through body awareness, self expression,
                            movement and feminine empowerment. The instructor will lead you through meditative flow along
                            with learned sensual movements and rhythmic sequences that allows you to hold your power space
                            with confidence. Sensual Flow Technique or movement taps into your relationship with yourself
                            and your body image. You will experiment with how your body moves with or against something,
                            when to soften, when to stop, when to move rapidly, back slowly etc., all the nuances can be
                            symbolic and wildly liberating.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Self-Love Photography Series Level 1</h4>
                        <p>Our goal with our Self-Love photography is for one to experience a sense of liberation through the
                            lens. We wish for all to feel beautiful in their own skin and restore a positive body image.
                            The idea is to improve self-confidence and allow yourself to be vulnerable through the transformative
                            study. To find beauty in the attention given as the photographer as well as the subject. By being
                            both the model and artist/photographer you will begin to see the photos as a work of art, the
                            body as a landscape to be accepted and cherished. It will be broken down into two sections with
                            partners of two. You will be asked to explore the space with your partner for the individual
                            photo shoots. You will be supported throughout the creative with experience, suggestions and
                            guidance offered.</p>
                        <p>You will...</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The 2 hour session will be exploration and a communal experience. The following week's 30 min session
                            will be solo and held privately in the studio for you to create your self-portraits through mirroring
                            and capturing your reflection on film. There is something very personal and therapeutic in finding
                            your own beauty, as well when witnessing the journey of another. We have found the photo shoots
                            to be personally transformative, liberating and promoting of self love.

                        <p>
                            As you learn to tap into your inner truth and your sensual self, you must also learn how to communicate from this place.
                            This is a new depth of our soul that may be unfamiliar to us and to others. In order to really
                            speak from this place within us, we must let go of our egos. We will really focus on our breath
                            to help us dig deeper into our truest selves. We will visualize our our truth releasing from
                            our bodies and repeat it until it penetrates our souls. We will focus on movements and poses
                            that open our throat chakras and allow us to see and speak our truths. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>“She let go. Without a thought or a word, she let go.”</p>

                        <p>We have scratched the surface of our sensual selves and now it’s time to learn who we really are
                            once we have learned to let go of our ego. We will learn to move with intention focusing on all
                            the senses in our bodies from touch, to sight, to sound. As you move really feel the music and
                            the beat pulsing through your body allowing the the sounds to move your body freely. Close your
                            eyes and bring all of your focus to your body, not worrying about how it looks but only feeling
                            how it moves. What is it that your body wants to say? </p>

                        <p>It is time to release your truth. Once you have found your truth and then have spoken your truth,
                            it is time to let it go to the universe so that it can become your truth. We will focus on how
                            we express ourselves to the outside world and how that world perceives who we are. Are we truly
                            communicating our truest selves to others? Or are we still hiding behind layers of fear and self
                            doubt? We can only be open to abundance and new opportunities if we can truly let go and allow
                            others to see who we really are. The time is now to let go of judgements, to release our fears,
                            and embrace who we truly are so that we can share this gift with everyone that we meet. </p>

                        <h4>Sacred, Sensual Self Level 3</h4>
                        <p>Now we must acknowledge that we all meet each other at the center. Everyone has their own story.
                            Let us take off our “coat” and our “armor” and see what emerges. We will always meet back in
                            the center connecting the spiral and flow of the universal love and energy. We will learn how
                            to dance and move together as one through various techniques including contact improv. Each student
                            will have the opportunity to lead the entire group and feel what it’s like to hold space for
                            others while sharing intimate parts of themselves. We will learn how to communicate with others
                            via movement and non-verbal cues. This allows us to create a stronger connection with each other
                            and allow the universal love and energy to flow between us. In the end we will be able to move
                            seamlessly and fluidly as one being.</p>

                    <p>My name is Christina and I am the founder of Fleur de Femme. I started this program based on what it
                        has also given me. The guts of this program is what I was able to reflect and naturally gather from
                        all my experiences. I was a nude model for years for art classes and private photographers at a time
                        when I felt extremely uncomfortable in my body (all through the 90's early 2000’s). I was a performance
                        artist for years using my body, improvising mostly, and a conceptual artist. Some examples of my
                        art includes hanging myself from a meat hook; wrapping my body in corsets and hanging in a cocoon
                        of them; undressing from the corset and biting into a beet, which to me symbolized the heart; and
                        making a cast of my body and then a wax mold to hang on the hooks.</p>
                    <p>I started stripping when I was 28. I never stepped foot in a club like that prior. I named myself Bliss.
                        I danced my heart out on stage but then I had to learn to interact with men. I had no confidence
                        with this task and that was the only way to make money. The other girls trained me and taught me
                        the moves. I watched and learned. I stumbled and felt super shy and awkward. Yes, tequilla became
                        my close friend who opened the dark doors.</p>
                    <p>In a short amount of time, I felt wild, and free. I felt a sense of compassion for myself and most men
                        I danced for and talked with. It was a strange dance between the primal naughty and the exchange
                        of energy from one person to the other. I felt free to be vain or celebrate my body and the body
                        of other dancers. I felt free to be "into" myself. It was not all narcissistic! I was profoundly
                        beautiful and times in which it had nothing to do with the men. Just the self. Strippers like to
                        watch themselves and see other watching them - there is a deep psychology in that and about the life
                        in the club.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to bring this experience to other women, but in a safe place without the dangers of working
                        in a club. I created this program using all of the experiences and techniques that shaped who I am
                        today. </p>

                    <p>Cristina Romanello reveals the inner mysteries of the commonplace, allowing her audience to ponder the
                        beauty of the scenes we so often take for granted. Cristina succeeds in evoking our sense of wonder
                        by unveiling the usual to reveal the exceptional.</p>
                    <p>Her passion demanded that she put the art before the course- she developed her style in her hometown,
                        Cleveland, with only a disposable camera and the wet streets as her studio. After studying photography
                        professionally, she found the last piece she needed to create a world of beauty we might never have
                        glimpsed if we hadn't looked twice.</p>

                    <p>My name is Wanida and I’m the lead coach for Fleur de Femme. The moment that Christina told me what she
                        wanted to do and accomplish with this program, I instantly fell in love. It encompassed everything
                        that I loved about pole at Be Studios and aspects of my personal life that have helped me heal my
                        inner wounds and become my truest self.
                    </p>
                    <p>Teaching all the levels of Fleur the first time was such an amazing healing and learning experience for
                        me. I learned so much about myself and grew in ways that I couldn’t even imagine would happen. I
                        had been teaching yoga and pole, but this was so much more. This was full of heart, of passion, of
                        soul. We cried. We laughed. We really allowed ourselves to be vulnerable and formed a bond I thought
                        could never be broken. </p>
                    <p>As I’ve continued to lead women through this experience I’ve learned how to really hold space for them
                        to let them release their fears, their doubts, and to really let there walls come down with no fear
                        of judgement. What’s most beautiful and most important is Fleur is to have that safe space to explore
                        who you really are without the outside world telling you who you should be or that you’re not good
                        enough. This really allows you to find, what’s my voice and what is someone else’s. And once you’re
                        able to find your own voice, to find the confidence to share it with the world even if they don’t
                        understand it. Because ultimately, true sexiness is authentic confidence in who you are.</p>
