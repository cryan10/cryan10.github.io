                            <strong>POLE FITNESS</strong> is an excellent way to build full-body strength. We offer classes at beginner,
                            intermediate and advanced levels. All of our classes begin with a warm-up focused on full-body
                            strengthening and flexibility. Students spend the remainder of class learning pole tricks individually
                            tailored to each student's level of experience.</p>

                        <h4>Pole Beginners Level 1</h4>
                        <p>Beginners level classes place additional emphasis on strength and flexibility conditioning. Level
                            1 focuses on basic climbs, spins and combos.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Pole Beginners Level 2</h4>
                        <p>Level 2 focuses on building upon the basics as well as executing techniques and mastering control
                            on the spinning pole, basic inversion and building your strength to prepare you for intermediate
                            level challenges.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Pole Mixed Levels</h4>
                        <p>Mixed-Level classes are designed to accommodate all levels. Students will advance at their own desired
                            pace, based on current experience and fitness level.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Advanced Pole Tricks</h4>
                        <p>Advanced Pole Tricks is designed for the intermediate-to-advanced dancer looking for a challenge.
                            Students will work on inverted and upright tricks with only two to three points of contact</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Pole Passion</h4>
                        <p>Pole Passion is all about the sensual flow of pole dance. We will begin with a more sensual warmup,
                            letting the music move our body, while focusing on body and hip rolls. For the bulk of the class
                            we will choreograph a small routine focusing on transitioning 3-4 spins and tricks together.
                            The choreography will be broken down piece by piece, allowing time to practice each spin or trick.
                            At the end of class, we will dance the choreography together.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>**It is highly recommended to take at least 1 pole class prior to this class to become familiar with
                            the pole</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Power Pole</h4>
                        <p>Power Pole is designed to build the strength necessary for executing advanced pole holds and transitions
                            as well as correct technique of various pole grips.</p>

                    <p>Jane’s pole style is focused on strengthening and tricks. She loves the freedom of pole. That there is
                        no right or wrong in pole. She hopes that her students find confidence and the ability to love their
                        body in her class. She wants to have her students realize how strong they really are. </p>
                    <p>Jane has been doing pole for 4 years now and has been teaching on and off for about 2 years. She started
                        pole because of her best friend. She bought her a pole package for her 25th birthday and she fell
                        in love with it (although at first she was very skeptical about it before she actually tried it).
                        Her favorite tricks are the jade split, french twist, shoulder dismount and ayesha.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole, Jane likes to read, sleep, and loves food. She also has the cutest little dog, Delly,
                        that she really loves. You can find Jane teaching regularly at our Mayfield Heights Pop Up location
                        and occasionally subbing for classes on the West side.</p>

                        She started doing pole about 3-4 years ago and has been teaching for over a year. She wants her students
                        to feel confident to try anything and have a good foundation to progress through pole at a safe pace.</p>
                    <p>Nicole danced ballet for 13 years when she was younger and had to quit because she couldn’t afford it.
                        Quitting such a huge passion of hers left her feeling empty and when she found pole it filled the
                        void. She always wanted to teach dance and taking a pole class allowed her to fulfill that dream
                        in a way she had not imagined. What she loves about pole is how it has let her truly be herself,
                        to be the most fearless person she can be not only in dance but in all aspects of her life. Her favorite
                        tricks are the ballerina spin, butterfly, and one arm spins.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole she has 11-12 years of healthcare experience working as a medical assistant and now she
                        teaches it. She has grown up in Cleveland and absolutely loves everything about this city. She’s
                        married and has 1 daughter and a dog. She enjoys spending time with her family, traveling and enjoying
                        live music.</p>

                    <p>Wanida’s pole style is all about freedom of expression, sensuality, and confidence. While she loves to
                        do fancy tricks and spins, Wanida finds the beauty of pole in each individual’s own expression and
                        personality. Many of her classes focus on helping students find their own inner voice and learning
                        how to express it. She hopes to help students feel empowered and confident in their own body and
                        mind. She wants to help students create better body and mind awareness and find comfort in their
                        own sensuality and soul. She aims to give students a safe place to explore and be themselves with
                        no judgement so that they can lead a more authentic life both on and off the pole.</p>
                    <p>Wanida started pole in January of 2014 and began teaching in January 2015. She had always been drawn
                        to dance and sensual movement, and dabbled in gymnastics as a kid (the uneven bars being her favorite).
                        Her favorite thing about pole is the freedom, strength, and confidence it has given her. Having lost
                        her childhood best friend to complications from bulimia 10 years ago, she has wanted to help other
                        women realize the beauty within themselves just as they are and to help them find their own strength
                        and courage to truly be themselves in a world that is constantly trying to tell you that you aren’t
                        good enough. What she loves about pole is the community of supportive women that help you see your
                        greatness, especially when you’re unable to see it yourself. Her favorite tricks are superman, butterfly,
                        and hair flips. </p>
                    <p>Wanida also manages Be Studios so you will frequently see her at the front desk. Her biggest passion
                        is pole, the studio, and it’s community of members. Outside of the studio, she also teaches yoga
                        and meditation. She has the cutest little dog, Oliver. She loves to be outside, do pilates, go shopping,
                        and eat lots of Thai food.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>Janice’s pole style is focused on strength and tricks. She started doing pole 3 years ago in April of
                        2014 and has been teaching for 1 year. She started pole about six months after she lost her eight-year-old
                        son due to complications from cerebral palsy. It was the start of the healing process for her. After
                        spending months in bed unable to function, she doesn’t know what motivated her to try pole but she
                        did. It was the first hour in six months that she was not lost in grief because she had to focus
                        so hard on what she was doing that she couldn’t think about her loss. Little by little, pole strengthened
                        her physically and mentally. She hopes to give her students that same sense of empowerment, confidence,
                        and an inner strength that will carry people through hard times.</p>
                    <p>What Janice loves about pole is the strength our our community and friendships. Her favorite part of
                        pole is the strength that she has gained both physically and mentally. Her favorite tricks are jade,
                        shooting star, and the holly drop.</p>
                    <p>Outside of Be Studios, Janice loves to run and travel. She is an avid runner and has participated in
                        a few triathlons and marathons. She also loves to spend time with her husband and beautiful children.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>Erin doesn’t like to label her pole style but if she had to she’d call it sassy — a little too awkward
                        to say it sexy, but her playful/flirty side definitely comes through. She tends to incorporate more
                        strength based tricks, but she’s also been working on adding more fluidity to her movements as it
                        doesn’t come naturally for her.</p>
                    <p>Erin believes that exercise should be FUN and she likes to bring that energy to her classes. We each
                        have our own unique abilities and strengths and she tries to nourish that in her students. She hopes
                        that her students leave class feeling empowered to pursue their goals on and off the pole. She fell
                        in love with pole because the only wrong way to pole dance is to do something that leads to injury;
                        otherwise, you can just relax and experiment with different movements until you find your own flow.
                        With regard to tricks, she enjoys the sense of accomplishment that she gets from progressing from
                        barely being able to get into a new move to mastering it. Her absolute favorite trick is Superman,
                        but she is also a huge fan of Gemini and Scorpio leg hangs (inside and outside leg hands), as well
                        as the Peter Pan.</p>
                    <p>Erin has been a pole student for about 3.5 years. She started teaching pole in May of 2017, but is an
                        ACE certified group fitness instructor and has specialty certifications in FXP Hula Hoop and POUND
                        which she has been teaching since 2015. Erin started her fitness journey by taking Zumba classes.
                        She had read research studies suggesting that physical activity can be therapeutic and wanted something
                        to help her deal with some of the emotional baggage that came with her divorce. After about a year
                        of taking Zumba, she learned about pole fitness and was instantly attracted to it because it was
                        so different from anything else she she would normally do. Shortly thereafter, she saw the Be Studios
                        Groupon in an email and decided to take the plunge. It was one of the best decisions she’s made because
                        she’s been hooked ever since. She’s always been kind of quiet and reserved, but pole has emboldened
                        her to step outside of her comfort zone so that she can continue to evolve and grow as a person.
                        She’s definitely an introvert at heart, but she’s now much more comfortable letting other faces of
                        her personality shine through.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole Erin enjoys reading and spending time with family and friends. She’s also a closet Candy
                        Crush addict — the Soda Saga version, not the original. She’s on level 1229. </p>

                    <p>Brittany doesn’t have a specific pole style but tends to gravitate towards strength moves. Dancing “sexy”
                        doesn’t come naturally but she still tries! She hopes that her students find a safe place to express
                        themselves and celebrate their accomplishments in her classes. She believes that the best part about
                        teaching is how each client is different and brings their own style. Teaching different levels of
                        dancers has helped her grasp when to help push and encourage people to help them succeed. She’s big
                        on correct form and good spotting to help prevent injuries.</p>
                    <p>Brittany loves that she can make pole whatever she wants. She can dance happy, mad, sad, use pole for
                        a workout or for mental clarity. Ultimately the pole family/sisterhood is what keeps her coming back.
                        She loves unique transitions and combos and doesn’t have a specific favorite trick. She’s been doing
                        pole for about 5 years and teaching for 2 years. She got into pole because of a youtube video of
                        Jenyne Butterfly when she was younger and always wanted to do it since then. She started during graduate
                        school at BW and it was the best release for all her stress.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole she grew up racing bmx and still rides he bike a lot. She has a 5-year-old golden retriever
                        fur-baby (Val) who loves to swim in the lake. She’s a hyperactive perrson so she’s always doing something
                        like baking or crafting when she has time off.</p>

                        and flow. She hopes that her students are able to find the courage to accept themselves and the freedom
                        to express themselves. She began doing pole because of the shame that she felt. She was sick of being
                        ashamed of her body and her sensuality. Pole has helped her heal and regain her freedom and confidence.
                        She has been doing pole for over 3 years and has been teaching off and on for 2 years.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole Maya Soul is interested in psychology, art therapy, finance, and being a badass. “Dim

                    <p>Rachael’s pole style is dramatic. She loves to dance to darker song lyrics to show there is grace through
                        life’s toughest times. She started pole because she wanted to exercise in a way that created art.
                        For a long time she struggled with severe depression and with the help of pole she was taken off
                        of medicine and found joy in every aspect of life. Rachael’s favorite thing about pole is the expression
                        of love for ones self. She learned to love herself through depression because of pole. She wants
                        to share that love with her students and hopes that most of all her students feel encouraged in class.
                        She wants them to know that they are capable of amazing things they did not know they could do. Rachael
                        has been doing pole for about 2 years and recently started teaching in the spring of 2017. Her favorite
                        moves are leg hands and ballerina.</p>

                        came to her first class after having been convinced by a friend and fell in love with pole immediately.
                        She’s been doing pole off and on for 4 years and has gained more interest over the past couple of
                        years and pushed herself to grow and improve. She’s been teaching for 2 years and wants her students
                        to be able to execute moves with no confusion. She loves teaching beginners because she loves to
                        see them nail the moves and the excitement on their faces. Irina loves pole because it is so diverse.
                        There are so many styles and there is no ceiling. You can improve and continue to grow as much as
                        you want to. Her favorite moves are handsprings, handstands and split moves.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole she also loves lyra (aerial hoop), working out and relaxing when she can. She is a RN

                        others the same tricks that got him addicted to Pole.</p>
                    <p>After being cast in a show as a character with some Pole skills, Mike took a class thinking that he could
                        quickly learn a few tricks to impress the crowd. Well, they didn’t use a pole in the production,
                        but Mike was hooked. For the past 2 years he has been working on perfecting a Flagpole deadlift into
                        the Brass Monkey. It’s getting there. Mike fell in love with atmosphere of the studio as well as
                        those moments where you finally nail that move that you have been working on for months.</p>
