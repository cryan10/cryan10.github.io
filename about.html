                            <strong>BE FITNESS</strong> started as Be Studios, a pole fitness and dance studio in 2007
                            by Christina
                            Anderson. Christina has been a dancer since she was 5 years old in the Canton Ballet and
                            has
                            a B.A. in Studio Art and Dance. She has spent her life studying and exploring different
                            forms
                            of dance. She has traveled to Spain to study flamenco; Austin, TX and Haiti to study
                            Afro-Haitian
                            dance; and San Francisco to study Afro-Brazilian dance, Tribal Belly Dance and Iyengar
                            yoga.
                            She wanted to open up a dance studio that thought outside of the box. She found healing in
                            stylized
                            movement that was feminine and strong, and she wanted to share this with other women. At
                            the
                            time, Be Fitness was the only pole dance studio in the Cleveland area and pole fitness was
                            just
                            starting to become a national fitness trend.</p>

                                student and instructor showcases three times a year as a way for the pole community to
                                come
                                together
                                and share their hard work. These events are open to the public if you have ever wanted
                                to
                                see

                            <p>The studio added Pilates reformer machine classes in 2015. Christina studied Pilates for
                                many years
                                and always used Pilates as a warm-up in her dance classes. It was the perfect addition
                                to
                                the
                                studio. The Pilates department now has its own space with 6 Pilates reformer machines
                                and
                                Wunda
                                chairs. Classes run 7 days a week in the morning and evenings. We were voted Cleveland

                        <p>Be Fitness has become a supportive space for people to get into their bodies and feel
                            comfortable
                            with physical self-expression. We have a community of students and staff that are
                            passionate,
                            kind and authentic. We believe
                            that the quality of the individual’s experience is the most important element at Be
                            Fitness.

                        <p>Owning Be Fitness has been one of the most fulfilling parts of Christina’s life. "It's is
                            like riding
                            a wave," she says, "constantly moving and changing. At times it can be uncomfortable, but
                            mainly
                            it’s about learning to thrive in the unknown. You trust it because you love it; you believe
                            and
                            keep stepping forward without a safety net."</p>
                        <p> If you feel you have this kind of passion and drive, we would love to have you join our
                            team! We
                            offer various licensing options to open up your own Be Fitness as one fitness department or

                        <p>At Be Fitness we value our students first and foremost. We hold each and every person who
                            walks into
                            this door with high regard and admire them for taking the time step out of their comfort
                            zone,
                            sharing this space with us, and trusting us to guide them. It is a privilege for us to
                            share
                            our knowledge and skills with all of our students.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3 class="section-title">INTEGRITY</h3>
                        <p>We believe in being honest and transparent with those who decide to enter our space. For us,
                            integrity
                            is a choice that we make consistently every day to be present and authentic with all of our
                            students.
                            This means showing up on time and consistently teaching well-rounded classes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3 class="section-title">KINDNESS</h3>
                        <p>We strive to provide an environment for our students that is friendly, warm, and
                            considerate. This
                            all starts with being kind and loving to ourselves, so that we are best able to share that
                            love
                            with our students. All of us are here to be patient and listen while you overcome your
                            fears
                            and share the joy as you reach your fullest potential. </p>

                        <p>To be authentic is to be true to one’s own spirit. This is a very important goal for us as
                            it is
                            our goal to help our students learn to understand and be true to their own spirit.
                            Authenticity
                            is so much more than just passion and commitment. For us, being authentic means accepting
                            ourselves
                            and our mistakes, understanding our emotions, and learning from the process that unfolds.

                        <p>Ultimately, our goal is to help our students become stronger and more confident in
                            themselves. We
                            believe that we are able to achieve this goal because all of us at Be Fitness started just
                            like
                            you. We know what it’s like to be afraid to step into the studio and try something new; but
                            we
                            also know how transformational it is to overcome that fear and grow into something
                            stronger.
