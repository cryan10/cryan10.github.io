                            <strong>POLE FITNESS</strong> is an excellent way to build full-body strength. We offer classes in beginner,
                            intermediate, and advanced levels. We also offer two stylized dance classes that focus on choreography
                            and sensual movement. All of our classes begin with a warm-up for full-body strengthening and
                            flexibility. Students spend the remainder of class learning pole tricks individually tailored
                            to each student's level of experience. Whether you are a seasoned poler or you just want to try
                            something new, we have a class to fit your level.</p>

                        <h4>Pole Beginners Level 1</h4>
                        <p>Beginner level 1 classes place additional emphasis on strength and flexibility conditioning to help
                            you gain the strength needed for basic pole spins and tricks. Level 1 focuses on basic climbs,
                            spins, and beginner combos.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Pole Beginners Level 2</h4>
                        <p>Beginner level 2 focuses on building upon the basics as well as executing techniques and mastering
                            control on the spinning pole, basic inversions, and building your strength to prepare you for
                            intermediate level challenges. It is recommended that you are able to climb the pole and have
                            a strong basic tuck before moving to level 2 classes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Pole Mixed Levels</h4>
                        <p>Mixed-Level classes are designed to accommodate all levels. The instructor modifies moves to fit
                            each students' level, ranging from beginner to advanced. The class focuses on building strength
                            and flexibility to help you reach your pole goals. Students advance at their own desired pace,
                            based on current experience and fitness level.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Advanced Pole Tricks</h4>
                        <p>Advanced Pole Tricks is designed for the intermediate-to-advanced pole student looking for a challenge.
                            Students work on inverted and upright tricks with only two to three points of contact. It is
                            strongly recommended that you are able to invert and hold basic inverted tricks before moving
                            into advanced level classes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Pole Passion</h4>
                        <p>Pole Passion is all about the sensual flow of pole dance. The class begins with a sensual warmup,
                            letting the music move our body, while focusing on body and hip rolls. For the bulk of the class
                            students learn a small choreographed routine focused on transitioning 3-4 spins and tricks together.
                            The choreography is broken down piece by piece and students are given time to practice each spin
                            or trick. At the end of class, students dance the choreography together. It is highly recommended
                            to take at least 1 beginner pole class prior to this class to become familiar with the pole and
                            basic spins and tricks.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Exotica</h4>
                        <p>In Exotica, emphasis is placed on the fundamentals of Russian-style exotic pole dance. Heel conditioning,
                            basework on both static and spin pole, tricks focused on leg waves, and floorwork are just some
                            of the basics that will be explored in class. This class is suited for all levels. Heels and
                            kneepads are a must!</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Power Pole</h4>
                        <p>Power Pole is designed to build the strength necessary for executing intermediate to advanced pole
                            holds and transitions as well as correct technique of various pole grips. This is an intermediate
                            to advanced level class focusing on inverted tricks with 2 to 3 points of contact. </p>

                            such as Pole Sport Organization and Pole Championship Series. It consists of 10 workshops that
                            cover things you will be judged on, such as variety of movement, control, form, flow, and more.
                            In addition to the workshops, we offer weekly free open pole sessions for our competitors and
                            weekly support group sessions to cover various topics and concerns about competing. Whether it’s
                            your first competition or you’ve competed numerous times before, this workshop series will help
                            you prepare and find support amongst your peers so that you don’t face this journey alone. </p>

                    <p>Tori teaches specialty pole workshops centered around choreography and dance technique. She has been
                        dancing for 22 years and is thrilled to be working with Be Studios. She has trained in Ballet, Jazz,
                        Tap, Modern, Contemporary, Hip Hop, and Musical Theater. Tori has a BA degree in Dance from Slippery
                        Rock University and is currently teaching and performing all over the Cleveland area. Tori started
                        her pole journey at Be Studios in 2015 and has loved combining her classical dance training with
                        this amazing and unique art form.</p>
                    <p>One of the things Tori loves most about dance and pole is that they allow a freedom of expression through
                        movement when words aren't quite right. She wants her students to feel like they can express themselves
                        and move through a sense of poise and grace while still building technical skills that can be used
                        in all dance forms. </p>

                    <p>Carrie teaches specialty workshops at Be Studios that are focused on musicality and storytelling. Her
                        pole style places emphasis movement and dance technique. For her, pole dance is not a sport; it is
                        an art form. She believes that pointy toes, pretty lines, lyricism and musicality are more important
                        than learning the latest, trendy pole trick. She encourages her students to utilize pole dance as
                        a form of self-expression and creative outlet, not just as a workout.</p>
                    <p>Carrie has been pole dancing since 2014. Prior to her pole journey, she was a competitive Irish dancer
                        for 12 years. She continues to grow as a dancer by taking hip hop and stylized heels classes. Her
                        favorite pole tricks are spin combos and flexibility tricks.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole, Carrie is a classical guitarist and singer-songwriter. In her muggle life, she is a
                        web developer and created this website.</p>

                    <p>Nicole’s pole style is a little bit of everything; it’s hard for her to commit to one specific style.
                        She started doing pole in 2013 and has been teaching for over a year. She wants her students to feel
                        confident to try anything and have a good foundation to progress through pole at a safe pace.</p>
                    <p>Nicole danced ballet for 13 years when she was younger and had to quit because she couldn’t afford it.
                        Quitting such a huge passion of hers left her feeling empty and when she found pole it filled the
                        void. She always wanted to teach dance and taking a pole class allowed her to fulfill that dream
                        in a way she had not imagined. What she loves about pole is how it has let her truly be herself,
                        to be the most fearless person she can be in dance and in all aspects of her life. Her favorite tricks
                        are the ballerina spin, butterfly, and one arm spins.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole, she has 11-12 years of healthcare experience working as a medical assistant and now
                        she teaches it. She is a Cleveland native and absolutely loves everything about this city. She’s
                        married and has 1 daughter and a dog. She enjoys spending time with her family, traveling and enjoying
                        live music.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>Wanida’s pole style is all about freedom of expression, sensuality, and confidence. While she loves to
                        do fancy tricks and spins, Wanida finds the beauty of pole in each individual’s own expression and
                        personality. Many of her classes focus on helping students find their own inner voice and learning
                        how to express it. She hopes to help students feel empowered and confident in their own body and
                        mind. She wants to help students create better body and mind awareness and find comfort in their
                        own sensuality and soul. She aims to give students a safe place to explore and be themselves with
                        no judgement so that they can lead a more authentic life both on and off the pole.</p>
                    <p>Wanida started pole in January of 2014 and began teaching in January 2015. She had always been drawn
                        to dance and sensual movement, and dabbled in gymnastics as a kid (the uneven bars being her favorite).
                        Her favorite thing about pole is the freedom, strength, and confidence it has given her. Having lost
                        her childhood best friend to complications from bulimia 10 years ago, she has wanted to help other
                        women realize the beauty within themselves just as they are and to help them find their own strength
                        and courage to truly be themselves in a world that is constantly trying to tell you that you aren’t
                        good enough. What she loves about pole is the community of supportive women that help you see your
                        greatness, especially when you’re unable to see it yourself. Her favorite tricks are superman, butterfly,
                        and hair flips. </p>
                    <p>Wanida also manages Be Studios so you will frequently see her at the front desk. Her biggest passion
                        is pole, the studio, and its community of members. Outside of the studio, she also teaches yoga and
                        meditation. She has the cutest little dog, Oliver. She loves to be outside, do pilates, go shopping,
                        and eat lots of Thai food.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>Janice’s pole style is focused on strength and tricks. She started doing pole 3 years ago in April of
                        2014 and has been teaching since 2016. She started pole about six months after she lost her eight-year-old
                        son due to complications from cerebral palsy. It was the start of the healing process for her. After
                        spending months in bed unable to function, she doesn’t know what motivated her to try pole but she
                        did. It was the first hour in six months that she was not lost in grief because she had to focus
                        so hard on what she was doing that she couldn’t think about her loss. Little by little, pole strengthened
                        her physically and mentally. She hopes to give her students that same sense of empowerment, confidence,
                        and an inner strength that will carry people through hard times.</p>
                    <p>What Janice loves about pole is the strength our our community and friendships. Her favorite part of
                        pole is the strength that she has gained both physically and mentally. Her favorite tricks are jade,
                        shooting star, and the holly drop.</p>
                    <p>Outside of Be Studios, Janice loves to run and travel. She is an avid runner and has participated in
                        a few triathlons and marathons. She also loves to spend time with her husband and beautiful children.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>Erin doesn’t like to label her pole style but if she had to she’d call it sassy — a little too awkward
                        to say it's sexy, but her playful/flirty side definitely comes through. She tends to incorporate
                        more strength based tricks, but she’s also been working on adding more fluidity to her movements
                        as it doesn’t come naturally to her.</p>
                    <p>Erin believes that exercise should be FUN and she likes to bring that energy to her classes. We each
                        have our own unique abilities and strengths and she tries to nourish that in her students. She hopes
                        that her students leave class feeling empowered to pursue their goals on and off the pole. She fell
                        in love with pole because the only wrong way to pole dance is to do something that leads to injury;
                        otherwise, you can just relax and experiment with different movements until you find your own flow.
                        With regard to tricks, she enjoys the sense of accomplishment that she gets from progressing from
                        barely being able to get into a new move to mastering it. Her absolute favorite trick is superman,
                        but she is also a huge fan of gemini and scorpio leg hangs (inside and outside leg hands), as well
                        as the Peter Pan.</p>
                    <p>Erin has been a pole student since 2013. She started teaching pole in May of 2017, but is an ACE certified
                        group fitness instructor and has specialty certifications in FXP Hula Hoop and POUND which she has
                        been teaching since 2015. Erin started her fitness journey by taking Zumba classes. She had read
                        research studies suggesting that physical activity can be therapeutic and wanted something to help
                        her deal with some of the emotional baggage that came with her divorce. After about a year of taking
                        Zumba, she learned about pole fitness and was instantly attracted to it because it was so different
                        from anything else she she would normally do. Shortly thereafter, she saw the Be Studios Groupon
                        in an email and decided to take the plunge. It was one of the best decisions she has made because
                        she has been hooked ever since. She’s always been kind of quiet and reserved, but pole has emboldened
                        her to step outside of her comfort zone so that she can continue to evolve and grow as a person.
                        She’s definitely an introvert at heart, but she’s now much more comfortable letting other faces of
                        her personality shine through.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole Erin enjoys reading and spending time with family and friends. She’s also a closet Candy
                        Crush addict — the Soda Saga version, not the original.</p>

                    <p>Brittany doesn’t have a specific pole style but tends to gravitate towards strength moves. Dancing “sexy”
                        doesn’t come naturally but she still tries! She hopes that her students find a safe place to express
                        themselves and celebrate their accomplishments in her classes. She believes that the best part about
                        teaching is how each student is different and brings their own style. Teaching different levels of
                        dancers has helped her grasp when to help push and encourage people to help them succeed. She’s big
                        on correct form and good spotting to help prevent injuries.</p>
                    <p>Brittany loves that she can make pole whatever she wants. She can dance happy, mad, sad, and can use
                        pole for a workout or for mental clarity. Ultimately the pole family/sisterhood is what keeps her
                        coming back. She loves unique transitions and combos and doesn’t have a specific favorite trick.
                        She’s been doing pole since 2012 and started teaching in 2015. She got into pole because of a YouTube
                        video she watched of Jenyne Butterfly when she was younger and always wanted to do it since then.
                        She started during graduate school at BW and it was the best release for all her stress.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole, Brittany grew up racing BMX and still rides he bike a lot. She has a 5-year-old golden
                        retriever fur-baby (Val) who loves to swim in the lake. She’s a hyperactive person so she’s always
                        doing something like baking or crafting when she has time off.</p>

                    <p>Maya Soul’s pole style is a stripped flow. She is focused on freedom of expression, simplicity, strength
                        and flow. She hopes that her students are able to find the courage to accept themselves and the freedom
                        to express themselves. She began doing pole because of the shame that she felt. She was sick of being
                        ashamed of her body and her sensuality. Pole has helped her heal and regain her freedom and confidence.
                        She has been doing pole for over 3 years and has been teaching off and on since 2014.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole Maya Soul is interested in psychology, art therapy, finance, and being a badass. “Dim

                    <p>Rachael’s pole style is dramatic. She loves to dance to darker song lyrics to show there is grace through
                        life’s toughest times. She started pole because she wanted to exercise in a way that created art.
                        For a long time she struggled with severe depression and with the help of pole she was taken off
                        of medicine and found joy in every aspect of life. Rachael’s favorite thing about pole is the expression
                        of love for one's self. She learned to love herself through depression because of pole. She wants
                        to share that love with her students and hopes that her students feel encouraged in class. She wants
                        them to know that they are capable of amazing things they did not know they could do. Rachael has
                        been doing pole for since 2015 and started teaching in the spring of 2017. Her favorite moves are
                        leg hangs and ballerina.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole Rachael enjoys knitting, adventuring to new places, trying new foods and working to make
                        others' lives more fulfilling. She also loves to design clothing and studied fashion at the University
                        of Akron. </p>

                    <p>Irina loves power moves and static pole. Recently she’s been getting more into exotic pole as well. She
                        came to her first class after having been convinced by a friend and fell in love with pole immediately.
                        She’s been doing pole off and on for since 2013 and has gained more interest over the past couple
                        of years and pushed herself to grow and improve. She’s been teaching since 2015 and wants her students
                        to be able to execute moves with no confusion. She loves teaching beginners because she loves to
                        see the excitement on their faces when they nail their first trick. Irina loves pole because it is
                        so diverse. There are so many styles and there is no ceiling. You can improve and continue to grow
                        as much as you want to. Her favorite moves are handsprings, handstands and split moves.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole she also loves lyra (aerial hoop), working out and relaxing when she can. She is a RN
                        at the Cleveland Clinic on a pulmonary/cardiac floor. </p>
