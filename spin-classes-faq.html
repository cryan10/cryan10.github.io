                        <p>Our Spinning &reg; program is certified through Mad Dogg Athletics, who provides <a href="https://spinning.com/getting-started/spinning-program-faqs/"
                                target="_blank"><u>the following FAQ</u></a> for new students:</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>I've never taken a Spinning class before. What should I expect?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Every class is a little different, but one of the great things about the Spinning program is
                            that it is adaptable to your fitness level. Remember that there's no competition. Listen to
                            your body and adjust the resistance on your bike accordingly. If you're a first timer, let
                            your instructor know. He or she can make sure your bike is properly adjustedand give you a
                            rundown on the Spinning &reg; program's five core movements and program fundamentals like
                            heart
                            rate training that will help you burn more calories, increase your strength and improve
                            your overall fitness.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Do I have to be in great shape to participate in a Spinning &reg; class?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Anyone can benefit from the Spinning &reg; program. And because you can go at your own pace
                            by
                            controlling the resistance on your Spinner &reg; bike, taking Spinning &reg; classes is a
                            great way to
                            get fit and reach your fitness goals.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>What makes Spinning &reg; class different from other group exercise classes?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Top-notch instructors, invigorating music and visualization come together to make Spinning
                            &reg;
                            class both fun and effective. If you've ever left a group exercise class feeling
                            frustrated, you'll appreciate that there are no complicated moves to learn with the
                            Spinning program. Regardless of how fit, flexible or coordinated you are, you'll get a
                            great workout. Simply hop on your bike, set the resistance to the level that's right for
                            you, and let your instructor guide you through an incredible ride.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>How many calories will I burn in a Spinning &reg; class, and what is the
                                approximate
                                equivalent distance in road miles traveled?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>The number of calories you'll burn depends on a number of factors, including your weight and
                            the intensity at which you exercise. Research indicates that on average, participants burn
                            about 400–600 calories in a 40-minute workout. The "distance" traveled depends on cadence;
                            however as an estimate, an average 40-minute class at a cadence of 80–110 rpm is equivalent
                            to approximately 15–20 miles on the road.

                            <strong>How is taking a Spinning &reg; class different than just riding a stationary bike?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Spinning &reg; class makes riding a stationary more bike fun by adding variety and
                            visualization
                            into your workout. A motivating group setting, energizing music and inspiring instructors
                            make Spinning class an incredible experience.
                        </p>

                            <strong>What type of gear do I need to participate in a Spinning class?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Comfortable workout attire is all you need to get started. But the right gear can make a
                            great class even better. Padded cycling shorts and moisture-wicking tops will make your
                            ride more comfortable and a heart rate monitor will help you get the most from every
                            workout.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Will taking Spinning &reg; classes make my legs bulk up?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>The "climbs" that are incorporated into a Spinning &reg; class simulate the experience of
                            riding
                            up a hill. Climbing is an excellent way to build strength, which means you not only get
                            shapelier legs but also stoke your metabolism since muscle needs more calories to sustain
                            itself than fat does. However, most climbs only last a few minutes, which is not enough
                            time to build big, bulky leg and butt muscles. If you're ever in doubt, share your training
                            goals with your instructor and ask them to help you create the ride that's right for you.

                            <strong>How can I get more comfortable sitting on the saddle?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you're new to the Spinning &reg; program it may take a few sessions for your body to get
                            used
                            to the saddle. Wearing padded cycling shorts or using a gel seat cover will definitely make
                            your ride more comfortable.
                        </p>

                            <strong>Sometimes my toes go numb while I'm riding. How can I solve this problem?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>The most common cause of numbness is restricted blood flow to the feet, which can be caused
                            by shoes, shoelaces or toe straps that are too tight. Loosening laces and straps often
                            solves the problem. If this doesn't help, you may want to consider foam insoles or
                            front-ended orthotics. They can provide relief by redistributing pressure on the ball of
                            your foot.

                            <strong>How can cycling shoes help me in a Spinning &reg; class?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Cycling shoes are made with a very stiff sole that enables more powerful pedal strokes.
                            Cycling shoes can also be used with clipless pedals, which facilitate a push/pull action
                            and more efficient pedal strokes.

                            <strong>Why should I wear a heart rate monitor in Spinning &reg; class?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Spinning &reg; program consists of five Energy Zones. These Energy Zones vary in
                            intensity
                            and are based upon certain percentages of your maximum heart rate. By wearing a heart rate
                            monitor, you will be better equipped to assess the intensity of your ride and determine
                            when to push harder, maintain your pace or reduce your effort. By taking the guesswork out
                            of your workout, you maximize your efficiency while minimizing your odds of over-training,
                            injury and burnout.

                            <strong>How do I calculate my maximum heart rate?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>The best place to start is with the age predicted formula, which is calculated by
                            subtracting your age from 220 if you are a male and from 226 if you're a female. For
                            example, if you're a 30 year-old man, your Age Predicted Maximum Heart Rate would be 190.

                            <strong>If I have an injury from another sport, is Spinning &reg; class a good alternative?
                            </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>While taking a Spinning &reg; class may be an excellent way to cross train, only your doctor
                            can
                            determine if the Spinning &reg; program is a safe option for you.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Why is pedaling backward not recommended?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Pedaling backward is risky on a fixed gear bike. If riders try to quickly stop the flywheel
                            while pedaling backward, the compressive forces on the knee joint can be sufficient enough
                            to tear cartilage or the meniscus. Also, pedaling backward may hyperextend the legs, which
                            could damage the ACL or other soft tissue of the knee joints. Aside from being risky, a
                            further reason not to do it is that there is no physiological advantage to it. A study in
                            the <i>Strength and Conditioning Journal</i> showed that muscle contribution and metabolic
                            cost
                            were the same for pedaling forward and backward. Lastly, this movement puts the bike at
                            risk as well. Pedaling backward may eventually unscrew the pedals from the crank arm.
