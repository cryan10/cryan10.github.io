                    <br />
                    <p>Wanida’s pole style is all about freedom of expression, sensuality, and confidence. While she loves to
                        do fancy tricks and spins, Wanida finds the beauty of pole in each individual’s own expression and
                        personality. Many of her classes focus on helping students find their own inner voice and learning
                        how to express it. She hopes to help students feel empowered and confident in their own body and
                        mind. She wants to help students improve their physical and mental awareness and find comfort in
                        their own sensuality and soul. She aims to give students a safe place to explore and be themselves
                        so that they can lead a more authentic life both on and off the pole.</p>
                    <p>Wanida started pole in January of 2014 and began teaching in January 2015. She had always been drawn
                        to dance and sensual movement, and dabbled in gymnastics as a kid (the uneven bars being her favorite).
                        Her favorite thing about pole is the freedom, strength, and confidence it has given her. Having lost
                        her childhood best friend to complications from bulimia 10 years ago, she has wanted to help other
                        women realize the beauty within themselves just as they are and to help them find their own strength
                        and courage to truly be themselves in a world that is constantly trying to tell you that you aren’t
                        good enough. What she loves about pole is the community of supportive women that help you see your
                        greatness, especially when you’re unable to see it yourself. Her favorite tricks are superman, butterfly,
                        and hair flips. </p>
                    <p>Wanida also manages Be Studios, so you will frequently see her at the front desk. Her biggest passion
                        is pole, the studio, and its community of members. Outside of the studio, she also teaches yoga and
                        meditation. She has the cutest little dog, Oliver. She loves to be outside, do pilates, go shopping,
                        and eat lots of Thai food.</p>

                    <p>Erin doesn’t like to label her pole style but, if she had to, she’d call it sassy — a little too awkward
                        to say it's sexy, but her playful/flirty side definitely comes through. She tends to incorporate
                        more strength based tricks, but she’s also been working on adding more fluidity to her movements
                        as it doesn’t come naturally to her.</p>
                    <p>Erin believes that exercise should be FUN and she likes to bring that energy to her classes. We each
                        have our own unique abilities and strengths and she tries to nourish that in her students. She hopes
                        that her students leave class feeling empowered to pursue their goals on and off the pole. She fell
                        in love with pole because the only wrong way to pole dance is to do something that leads to injury.
                        Otherwise, you can just relax and experiment with different movements until you find your own flow.
                        She enjoys the sense of accomplishment that she gets progressing from barely being able to get into
                        a new move to mastering it. Her absolute favorite trick is superman, but she is also a huge fan of
                        Gemini and Scorpio leg hangs (inside and outside leg hangs), as well as the Peter Pan.</p>
                    <p>Erin has been a pole student since 2013 and started teaching pole in May of 2017. She is an ACE certified
                        group fitness instructor and has specialty certifications in FXP Hula Hoop and POUND, which she has
                        been teaching since 2015. Erin started her fitness journey by taking Zumba classes. She had read
                        research studies suggesting that physical activity can be therapeutic and wanted something to help
                        her deal with some of the emotional baggage that came with her divorce. After about a year of taking
                        Zumba, she learned about pole fitness and was instantly attracted to it because it was so different
                        from anything else she she would normally do. Shortly thereafter, she saw the Be Studios Groupon
                        in an email and decided to take the plunge. It was one of the best decisions she has ever made because
                        she has been hooked ever since. Pole has emboldened her to step outside of her comfort zone so that
                        she can continue to evolve and grow as a person. She’s definitely an introvert at heart, but she’s
                        now much more comfortable letting other parts of her personality shine through.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole, Erin enjoys reading and spending time with family and friends. She’s also a closet Candy
                        Crush addict — the Soda Saga version, not the original.</p>

                    <p>Rachael’s pole style is dramatic. She loves to dance to darker song lyrics to show there is grace through
                        life’s toughest times. She started pole because she wanted to exercise in a way that created art.
                        For a long time she struggled with severe depression and with the help of pole she was taken off
                        of medicine and found joy in every aspect of life. Rachael’s favorite thing about pole is the expression
                        of love for one's self. She learned to love herself through depression because of pole. She wants
                        to share that love with her students and hopes that her students feel encouraged in class. She wants
                        them to know that they are capable of amazing things they did not know they could do. Rachael has
                        been doing pole since 2015 and started teaching in the spring of 2017. Her favorite moves are leg
                        hangs and ballerina.</p>
                    <p>Outside of pole Rachael enjoys knitting, adventuring to new places, trying new foods and working to make
                        others' lives more fulfilling. She also loves to design clothing and studied fashion at the University
                        of Akron. </p>
