                            <strong>How long have you been doing pole?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Almost six months</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>What made you decide to start pole classes? </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>I found a Groupon for classes and loved the idea even though I had never heard of it or
                            considered
                            doing anything like it before. I finally talked some friends of mine into going with me
                            because
                            I was too scared to do it on my own. After two classes my friends quit but I was addicted.
                            After
                            every class I couldn’t wait for the next one. It would be all I could think about for the
                            majority
                            of the week. Purchasing the Groupon was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made even
                            though
                            I was unaware of it at the time. Pole was so much more than working out and dancing. It was
                            like
                            a therapy that I never could have imagined.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>What was your first class like?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Intimidating. There were so many different levels of students in the class and I felt like a
                            baby
                            giraffe tripping over my feet. The only thing that made me think that I might be able to
                            eventually
                            get the moves was that I was able to climb the pole. I thought that if I could do that then
                            I
                            could keep attempting everything else. I also was unaware that I needed to work both sides
                            of
                            my body. I only did everything on my right side and so my right hand and arm were so sore
                            afterwards
                            that I could only drive with my left arm. Needless to say that wasn’t a mistake I made
                            again.</p>

                            <strong>What is your favorite trick?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have to choose just one?! I don’t think it’s possible! Every time I learn a new trick that
                            becomes
                            by favorite for a while. But anything that is inverted and spinning makes me feel like I’m
                            flying
                            which is an amazing feeling.</p>

                            <strong>What has been the biggest challenge since starting pole?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>For me the biggest challenge hasn’t been in any classes but outside of the studio. Dealing
                            with opposition
                            from friends, family, and even strangers has been the most difficult. Many people I care
                            about
                            were wrapped up in the negative connotation of pole dancing and therefore were extremely
                            unsupportive
                            and even mean about my participation. Having to recognize that I cannot change people’s
                            minds
                            and simply need to not care what they think was the biggest challenge for me. Honestly it
                            is
                            still challenging sometimes. I want my family to see the beauty and joy of pole that I
                            feel.
                            But I have to accept that that may never happen and that’s ok and doesn’t have to affect
                            the
                            way I experience pole.</p>

                            <strong>What is your dream trick to land?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>My dream trick changes daily. Every pole picture I see I want to do. Having the strength to
                            accomplish
                            an iron x, fonji, pole back flip, and so many more would be amazing. Adding the flexibility
                            of
                            moves like prawn, eagle, and birds of paradise among others would be insane. Oh, to dream.</p>

                            <strong>What is favorite part of pole fitness?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>The pole community. I love the workout, the feeling of finally getting new tricks, and being
                            able
                            to express myself through dance. But the love and support of the people in the pole
                            community
                            is like nothing I’ve ever experienced before. So many groups and communities claim to be
                            made
                            up of people who are supportive but this is the only community in which I have found that
                            to
                            completely be true. There’s a lack of pretense and raw openness that is incredibly
                            therapeutic
                            and refreshing. To me this is the most important part of my pole experience.</p>

                            <strong>What advice would you give to new pole students?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Keep going through the mental, emotional, and physical pain. It’s so incredibly worth it.</p>
