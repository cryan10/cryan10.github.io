                        <br>
                        <p>If you know anything about us here at Be Fitness, you know that we love to help people step
                            out of
                            their comfort zones. This year we guided fourteen of our students and instructors through
                            their
                            first pole competition. Everyone traveled to Chicago, IL to perform with over 200
                            competitors
                            in a weekend-long competition held by Pole Sport Organization (PSO). This was the first
                            time
                            that our studio traveled and competed as a team to an event like this. We spent months
                            preparing
                            together for this competition in various workshops, practices, and meetings. </p>
                        <p>This idea all started in May 2017 when one of our instructors competed on her
                            own in
                            this same competition. The experience was so life-changing that she wanted everyone at the
                            studio
                            to go through the same experience. Another instructor, Brittany Hansel, had previously
                            competed
                            in PSO in another city. This past year Brittany became Be Fitness’ PSO Unicorn. PSO
                            Unicorns
                            are studio ambassadors that know the ins and outs of PSO. Together with the studio manager,
                            Brittany created the first Be Fitness Competition Program. </p>
                        <p>We took 7 instructors and 7 students to this competition, most of them participating in our
                            competition
                            program. Our program originally consisted of 10 bi-weekly workshops helping to perfect the
                            student’s
                            routine focusing on the different elements that the judges critique including tricks, stage
                            presence,
                            and musicality. We’ve since updated the program to consist of 12 weekly workshops to help
                            students
                            choreograph their routine from start to finish.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <br />
                        <p>The program not only helped everyone work on their choreography and tricks, but also served
                            as emotional
                            support. We became a family in the process. There were nights that we stayed for hours
                            after
                            class talking about our fears and also the excitement. There’s something about going
                            through
                            a process like this that makes you really look at your life as a whole. You change as a
                            person
                            when you step out of your comfort zone and walk head on into your fears; but knowing that
                            you
                            have a whole team of women who have your back and are holding your hand through the process
                            makes
                            it so much easier. And in the end you come out so much stronger individually and as a
                            family.

                        <p>Erin, one of our instructors, competed in Entertainment Level 3 Senior and she felt that
                            love and
                            support from the team. “It’s hard for me to verbalize my competition experience because it
                            was
                            somewhat of an emotional roller coaster. During the preparation phase, I often found myself
                            wondering,
                            'What did I get myself into?' as I was stepping way beyond my comfort zone. The Be Fitness
                            competition
                            training program, however, provided a great foundation and gave me the courage to step on
                            stage
                            in Chicago. I’m glad I competed because it was an amazing experience that helped me gain
                            confidence
                            in my ability to confront my fears. I treasure the time spent with my Be Fitness family
                            before,
                            during, and after competition. The amount of support was awesome and I think we all would
                            agree
                            that we bonded and grew closer as a result of the experience.”

                        <p>One of our newer pole instructors and adult ballet teacher, Tori, won third place in
                            Entertainment
                            Level 2 Junior. She says, “Participating in the competition was very rewarding, not only in
                            the
                            result but also in the process. Everyone that participated in the competition program was
                            so
                            supportive and encouraging. We all had different strengths and specialties that we were
                            more
                            than willing to share. Even though we all competed individually, we were truly a team.
                            Knowing
                            that we were all there together made the nerves that come with competing almost
                            nonexistent.
                            I loved it and I would definitely do it again.”</p>

                        <p>Many of our students who competed had previously performed in our showcases. We hold these
                            showcases
                            a few times a year for both the pole and aerial departments. Performing on stage in
                            Chicago,
                            however, was a completely different atmosphere. “I've performed many times and said I'd
                            never
                            compete, but then all my pole sisters were joining the competition program. I knew I could
                            do
                            it with their support”, says long-time pole student Stacy, who won the gold medal in her
                            Championship
                            Level 3 Senior division. “Taking 1st place in my first competition was a life-changing
                            experience.
                            I never would have done it without the coaching and support of the staff at Be Fitness.”</p>
                        <p>Overall, what we all gained most from the experience was the confidence it brought, no
                            matter how
                            you ranked amongst your competitors. It takes real courage to get out there on stage and be
                            vulnerable
                            in front of hundreds of strangers. Pole and aerial instructor Rachael believes that
                            “although
                            competing is fun, the best part is the self-confidence boost afterwards. Regardless of
                            where
                            you rank among competitors, you really feel that you did something fantastic and you feel
                            pride
                            in your steps to get to where you are today.”</p>
                        <p>We really believe that that experience changes your life and you will carry that with you
                            forever.
                            Pole student Jessica, who won first place in her Dramatic Level 1 Senior division,
                            says,“Everything
                            I learned at Be Fitness led up to competing. I've been going to Be Fitness for four years.
                            When
                            I first started, I had never worked out in my life. I was out of shape, painfully weak, and
                            very
                            lazy. And through my instructors' inspiration, patience, and attention to help me grow as a
                            dancer,
                            I finally was able to build the courage to compete in PSO and win first place. The
                            experience
                            was immensely rewarding and validating. I am so thankful for everything Be Fitness has
                            given
                            me-- Strength, grace, memories, and an amazing pole family.”</p>

                        <p>Pole Sport Organization holds competitions throughout the US with two competitions held in
                            Chicago
                            (one in December and one in May). These competitions are open to all skill levels, from
                            beginner

                            dramatic,
                            and entertainment. There are also various age and level categories so that competitions
                            remain
                            fair to everyone.

                        <p>Our next competition program starts August 26th, with open house sessions in July and August
                            to answer
                            any questions you might have about competing and the program itself. Like our pole student
                            and
                            competitor Colleen says, “We 100% want to do it all over and compete again!”</p>
