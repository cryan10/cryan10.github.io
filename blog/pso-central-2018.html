                        <br>
                        <p>If you know anything about us here at Be Studios, you know that we love to help people step out of
                            their comfort zones. This year we guided fourteen of our students and instructors through their
                            first pole competition. Everyone traveled to Chicago, IL to perform with over 200 competitors
                            in a weekend-long competition held by Pole Sport Organization (PSO). This was the first time
                            that our studio traveled and competed as a team to an event like this. We spent months preparing
                            together for this competition in various workshops, practices, and meetings. </p>
                        <p>This idea all started in May 2017 when one of our instructors, Maya Soul, competed on her own in
                            this same competition. The experience was so life-changing that she wanted everyone at the studio
                            to go through the same experience. Another instructor, Brittany Hansel, had previously competed
                            in PSO in another city. This past year Brittany became Be Studios’ PSO Unicorn. PSO Unicorns
                            are studio ambassadors that know the ins and outs of PSO. Together with the studio manager, Brittany
                            and Maya Soul created the first Be Studios Competition Program. </p>
                        <p>We took 7 instructors and 7 students to this competition, most of them participating in our competition
                            program. Our program originally consisted of 10 bi-weekly workshops helping to perfect the student’s
                            routine focusing on the different elements that the judges critique including tricks, stage presence,
                            and musicality. We’ve since updated the program to consist of 12 weekly workshops to help students
                            choreograph their routine from start to finish.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <br/>
                        <p>The program not only helped everyone work on their choreography and tricks, but also served as emotional
                            support. We became a family in the process. There were nights that we stayed for hours after
                            class talking about our fears and also the excitement. There’s something about going through
                            a process like this that makes you really look at your life as a whole. You change as a person
                            when you step out of your comfort zone and walk head on into your fears; but knowing that you
                            have a whole team of women who have your back and are holding your hand through the process makes
                            it so much easier. And in the end you come out so much stronger individually and as a family.
                        </p>
                        <p>Erin, one of our instructors, competed in Entertainment Level 3 Senior and she felt that love and
                            support from the team. “It’s hard for me to verbalize my competition experience because it was
                            somewhat of an emotional roller coaster. During the preparation phase, I often found myself wondering,
                            'What did I get myself into?' as I was stepping way beyond my comfort zone. The Be Studios competition
                            training program, however, provided a great foundation and gave me the courage to step on stage
                            in Chicago. I’m glad I competed because it was an amazing experience that helped me gain confidence
                            in my ability to confront my fears. I treasure the time spent with my Be Studios family before,
                            during, and after competition. The amount of support was awesome and I think we all would agree
                            that we bonded and grew closer as a result of the experience.”

                        <p>One of our newer pole instructors and adult ballet teacher, Tori, won third place in Entertainment
                            Level 2 Junior. She says, “Participating in the competition was very rewarding, not only in the
                            result but also in the process. Everyone that participated in the competition program was so
                            supportive and encouraging. We all had different strengths and specialties that we were more
                            than willing to share. Even though we all competed individually, we were truly a team. Knowing
                            that we were all there together made the nerves that come with competing almost nonexistent.
                            I loved it and I would definitely do it again.”</p>

                        <p>Many of our students who competed had previously performed in our showcases. We hold these showcases
                            a few times a year for both the pole and aerial departments. Performing on stage in Chicago,
                            however, was a completely different atmosphere. “I've performed many times and said I'd never
                            compete, but then all my pole sisters were joining the competition program. I knew I could do
                            it with their support”, says long-time pole student Stacy, who won the gold medal in her Championship
                            Level 3 Senior division. “Taking 1st place in my first competition was a life-changing experience.
                            I never would have done it without the coaching and support of the staff at Be Studios.”</p>
                        <p>Overall, what we all gained most from the experience was the confidence it brought, no matter how
                            you ranked amongst your competitors. It takes real courage to get out there on stage and be vulnerable
                            in front of hundreds of strangers. Pole and aerial instructor Rachael believes that “although
                            competing is fun, the best part is the self-confidence boost afterwards. Regardless of where
                            you rank among competitors, you really feel that you did something fantastic and you feel pride
                            in your steps to get to where you are today.”</p>
                        <p>We really believe that that experience changes your life and you will carry that with you forever.
                            Pole student Jessica, who won first place in her Dramatic Level 1 Senior division, says,“Everything
                            I learned at Be Studios led up to competing. I've been going to Be Studios for four years. When
                            I first started, I had never worked out in my life. I was out of shape, painfully weak, and very
                            lazy. And through my instructors' inspiration, patience, and attention to help me grow as a dancer,
                            I finally was able to build the courage to compete in PSO and win first place. The experience
                            was immensely rewarding and validating. I am so thankful for everything Be Studios has given
                            me-- Strength, grace, memories, and an amazing pole family.”</p>

                        <p>Our next competition program starts August 26th, with open house sessions in July and August to answer
                            any questions you might have about competing and the program itself. Like our pole student and
                            competitor Colleen says, “We 100% want to do it all over and compete again!”</p>
