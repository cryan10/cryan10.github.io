                        <p>“When I dance, I dance also in my mind. I let the flow lead me. This improvisation is the ultimate
                            freedom in self-expression. Embracing how your body moves and how it responds to different textures,
                            temperatures and thoughts enhances your self-awareness. By allowing yourself to be vulnerable
                            and letting your flow infuse with your soul's natural rhythm, you learn clarity and self-love”.

                        <p>Level 1 of the Fleur de Femme Evolution Series is all about tapping into your sensual self and gaining
                            a greater understanding of yourself and your purpose. The series is split into 3 different workshops
                            over the course of 8 weeks. The first week is Body, Breath & Soul where we will get to know each
                            other while we begin our journey of self-discovery. The following weeks are focused on sensual
                            movement and dance. We will then do an intimate photography session in week 6 and reflect back
                            on it through movement in week 7. The final week is our performance week where we will share
                            our movement in a safe space.</p>

                        <h5>Body, Breath & Soul Level 1 </h5>
                        <p>
                            Body, Breath & Soul is about creating a sacred space for expressing yourself through journaling, movement, meditation and
                            spiritual connection. It’s about finding your truth by looking inward, peeling away layers, and
                            finding your true essence. We create our sacred space with meaningful personal items. Fill your
                            space with a meaningful quote or a poem, and any other items that uplift your spirit, such as
                            a rock, crystal or a feather. When we create space through rituals of prayer, meditation or dance,
                            we allow ourselves to be free from the ego. When we connect the heart and mind with our true
                            essence, a deep union of spirit can blossom.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>Sacred Sensual Self Level 1</h5>
                        <p>Sacred Sensual Self is about reclaiming your sensuality and merging your sensuality with your soul.
                            We do this through choreography that guides your loving being to self-expression and empowerment.
                            The instructor will lead you through meditative flow, sensual movements and rhythmic sequences
                            that allow you to confidently own your space. Sensual Flow Technique taps into your relationship
                            with yourself and your body image. All the nuances of flow movement can be symbolic and wildly
                            liberating.

                        <p>Our Self-Love Photography Series is meant for you to experience liberation through the lens. We wish
                            for you to feel beautiful in your own skin and nurture a positive body image. You will gain confidence
                            and experience vulnerability through this transformative study. The workshop will be broken down
                            into two sessions. For the first session, students will be paired up. You will be asked to explore
                            the space with your partner for the individual photo shoots. You will be supported throughout
                            the creative with experience, suggestions and guidance offered.</p>

                            and the acceptance and veneration of your body as a beautiful landscape. There is something very
                            personal and therapeutic in finding your own beauty, as well as witnessing the journey of another.
                            The 2 hour session will be an exploration and a communal experience.

                        <p>
                            As you learn to tap into your inner truth and your sensual self, you must also learn how to communicate from this place.
                            This is a new depth of our soul that may be unfamiliar to us and to others. In order to really
                            speak from this place within us, we must let go of our egos. We will focus on our breath to help
                            us connect to our truest selves. We will visualize our truth radiating from our bodies and repeat
                            this process so it penetrates our souls. We will focus on movements and poses that open our throat
                            chakras so we can better see and speak our truth. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>“She let go. Without a thought or a word, she let go.”</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>We have scratched the surface of our sensual selves and now it’s time to learn who we really are
                            without our ego. We will learn to move with intention by focusing on all the senses in our bodies.
                            As you move, really feel the music pulsing through your body. Close your eyes and bring your
                            focus to your body and how it feels, not how it looks, while you move. What is it that your body
                            wants to say? </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>Self-Love Photography Series Level 2</h5>
                        <p>Tap into your creative expression with body paint. Paint strokes will become a second skin, one to
                            express yourself with. Let colors, words and symbols express your soul in combination with the
                            movement of your body. Paint your body how you like, cover it or unveil it. The choice is yours.</p>
                        <p>Each participant will stand center stage while the other participants tap into their creativity and
                            become the artist/photographer, capturing your beauty as is.</p>

                        <h5>Body, Breath & Soul Level 3 </h5>
                        <p>It is time to release your truth. Once you have found and spoken your truth, you must surrender it
                            to the universe so that it can fully become yours. We will contemplate how we express ourselves
                            to the outside world and how that world perceives who we are. Are we communicating our truest
                            selves to others? Or are we still hiding behind layers of fear and self-doubt? We can only be
                            open to abundance and new opportunities if we can truly be vulnerable and allow others to see
                            who we really are. We will learn how to let go of judgments, release our fears, and embrace our
                            authentic selves so that we can share this gift with everyone we meet. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>Sacred Sensual Self Level 3</h5>
                        <p>Everyone has their own story. Let us take off our “coat” and “armor” and see what emerges. We will
                            reconnect to the spiral and flow of the universe's communal love and energy. We will learn how
                            to dance and move together as one through various techniques, including contact improvisation.
                            Each student will have the opportunity to lead the entire group and feel what it’s like to hold
                            space for others while sharing intimate parts of themselves. We will learn how to communicate
                            with others via movement and non-verbal cues. This allows us to create a stronger connection
                            with each other and allow universal love and energy to flow between us. By the end of the workshop,
                            we will be able to move seamlessly and fluidly as one being.</p>

                        <p>Soft, subtle, real and raw. Be at one with the elements. Feel the water wash over you, the breeze
                            float about you. The sand and dirt become a part of you. Look up to the sky, feel the sun, listen
                            to the universe.</p>

                                have the time to commit to the 8 week long integrated series.</strong> All the intensive
                            series cover the same material as the 8 week workshops but in one compressed weekend, 10 hours
                            over the course of 2 days. We will start the weekend with Body, Breath & Soul where we will get
                            to know each other while we begin our journey of self-discovery. The rest of the day is focused
                            on sensual movement and dance. The following day we will do an intimate photography session and
                            then reflect back on it through movement. The weekend ends with everyone performing and sharing
                            their movement in a safe space.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="modal-body">
                        <p>My name is Christina and I am the founder of Fleur de Femme. My own experience as a creative being
                            led me to create this program. It is inspired by what I was able to naturally gather from all
                            my personal experiences.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the 90s and early 2000s, I was a nude model for art classes and private photographers.
                            I also was a performance artist for years using my body, improvising mostly, and a conceptual
                            artist. Some examples of my art include hanging myself from a meat hook; wrapping my body in
                            corsets and hanging in a cocoon of them; undressing from the corset and biting into a beet, which
                            to me symbolized the heart; and making a cast of my body and then a wax mold to hang on the hooks.
                            Although my creativity was focused around my physical self, at the time, I felt extremely uncomfortable
                            in my body. </p>
                        <p>I started stripping when I was 28. I never stepped foot in a club like that prior. I named myself
                            Bliss. I danced my heart out on stage but then I had to learn to interact with men. I had no
                            confidence with this task, but it was the only way to make money. The other girls trained me
                            and taught me the moves. I watched and learned. I stumbled and felt super shy and awkward. Yes,
                            tequilla became my close friend who opened dark doors.</p>
                        <p>In a short amount of time, I felt wild and free. I felt a sense of compassion for myself and most
                            men I danced for and talked with. It was a strange dance between the primal naughty and the exchange
                            of energy from one person to the other. I felt free to be vain or celebrate my body and the body
                            of other dancers. I felt free to be "into" myself.</p>
                        <p>I wanted to bring this experience to other women, but in a safe place without the dangers of working
                            in a club. I created this program by using all of the experiences and techniques that shaped
                            me into who I am today.</p>

                        <p>Cristina Romanello reveals the inner mysteries of the commonplace, allowing her audience to ponder
                            the beauty of the scenes we so often take for granted. Cristina succeeds in evoking our sense
                            of wonder by unveiling the usual to reveal the exceptional.</p>
                        <p>Her passion demanded that she put the art before the course- she developed her style in her hometown,
                            Cleveland, with only a disposable camera and the wet streets as her studio. After studying photography
                            professionally, she found the last piece she needed to create a world of beauty we might never
                            have glimpsed if we hadn't looked twice.</p>

                        <p>My name is Wanida and I’m the lead coach for Fleur de Femme. The moment that Christina told me what
                            she wanted to accomplish with this program, I instantly fell in love. This program encompasses
                            everything I love about Be Fitness and aspects of my personal life that have helped me to heal
                            my inner wounds and become my truest self.
                        </p>
                        <p>Teaching the Fleur de Femme workshops for the first time was such an amazing experience. I learned
                            so much about myself and grew in ways that I couldn’t even imagine. Prior to Fleur de Femme,
                            I was teaching only yoga and pole, but this was so much more. These workshops were full of heart,
                            passion and soul. We cried. We laughed. We allowed ourselves to be vulnerable and formed a bond
                            I thought could never be broken. </p>
                        <p>As I continue to lead women through this experience, I’ve learned how to hold space for them so that
                            they can release their fears and doubts. They can let their walls come down with no fear of judgment.
                            What’s most beautiful about the Fleur de Femme program is having a safe space to explore who
                            you really are without the outside world telling you who you should be or that you’re not good
                            enough. This allows you to find your authentic self and the confidence to share it with the world,
                            even if others don’t understand it. Because, ultimately, true sexiness is genuine confidence
                            in who you are.</p>

                        <p>My name is Maya Soul, and after taking my first class at Be Fitness, I fell in love. The studio became
                            my home. Pole dance allowed me to unfold--I've overcome fear and shame, and released control
                            to allow life to flow.</p>
                        <p>I started teaching workshops and classes in 2013, and became a competitive pole athlete in 2017.
                            My style is diverse, which is one of the reasons I love pole. Pole doesn’t have to be defined;
                            you have complete freedom of expression. One moment you can be exotic, dramatic the next, powerful,
                            vulnerable, sexy, sad, angry…</p>
                        <p>In class, I empower my students to believe in themselves and build lasting confidence that transcends
                            the studio. We are all a family here at Be Fitness, and if I can share some of my passion to
                            light your fire, then my job is done.</p>
                        <p>Outside of pole, I enjoy psychology, business and good company.</p>
